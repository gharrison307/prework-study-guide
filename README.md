# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project provides a study guide to review the various concepts we learned about in the prework modules. By using HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript, we created a webpage to test out and explore various functions and methods of web development as well as the strategies and processes behind those methods. Through the project, we learned that a web application is built from many layers, each with their own specific function. We also became familiar with the Git flow and why it is useful as a developer. The project serves as the intial building block of our developer knowledge, and can be used as a reference guide for the future.
